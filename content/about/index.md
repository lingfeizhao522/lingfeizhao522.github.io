<!-- ## Introduction -->

I am an M.Eng student in the Operations Research & Information Engineering Department at Cornell University, concentrating in Data Analytics. I recently obtained my undergraduate degree in May 2024 from Cornell University as well, with a double major in Computer Science and Operations Research. My interests lie in data science and machine learning.
